####What My App do

My app can contain many lists. A list have many items.
A Item has title and details. A user can add or remove any of them.
A user can remove any of item or list one by one, or all of them at once.
Right now, it has any of bugs. 

I have two version of apps
- "WithListOfList" has many lists.
- "NoListOfList" can have just one list.

All of them perfectly works.

#### Overview

It's time to create your very first Android app - a to-do list app - that runs on a real Android device!

This might seem intimidating at first, but you have the ability to break down what you see on the screen into easily identifiable parts. Learning to both design an app and implement your designs are crucial skills to being a successful Android developer.

**You will be working individually for this project**. Think through your design carefully before you implement it in Android Studio. Test both the layout and functionality of each screen as you create them. Don't wait until the end!

---

#### Requirements

Your app must:

- **View a collection of to-do lists**
- **View items on a to-do list, including descriptions**
- Allow the user to **create a new to-do list**
- **Add items** to each to-do list
- Allow the user to **remove items from a to-do list**
- Allow the user to **remove an entire to-do list**
- Use two custom Java objects to contain your data for the **To Do Lists**, and the **To Do Items** in each **ToDoList**
- Show an error message if invalid input is given
- Persist data (your to-do-lists) while the app is open using a **singleton**

**Bonus:**

- Allow the user to check off completed items
- Allow the user to edit previously added items
- Persist data when the app closes and is re-opened

---

#### Code of Conduct

As always, your app must adhere to General Assembly's [student code of conduct guidelines](../../../resources/guidelines/code-of-conduct.md).

If you have questions about whether or not your work adheres to these guidelines, please speak with a member of your instructional team.

---

#### Necessary Deliverables

- A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often.
- **A ``readme.md`` file** describing what the app does, and any bugs that may exist.
- Pictures of your prototypes in the git repository
- At least one screenshot of your home screen in the `readme.md`

---

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Complete as much of the layout XML as possible before starting to write your logic
- Use the Android API documentation - it is very thorough and provides useful code samples
- Donâ€™t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems
- Write pseudocode before you write actual code (remember to think through the logic first!)

#### Project Feedback + Evaluation


Base on the requirements you can earn a maximum of 18 points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
